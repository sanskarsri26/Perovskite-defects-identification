# Image Clustering Using VGG16 and KMeans

This script clusters a set of images into predefined groups using features extracted from the VGG16 deep learning model. The clustered images are then copied to an output directory, renamed according to their cluster assignment.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need the following libraries installed:
- Keras
- TensorFlow (as backend for Keras)
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Glob
- OS

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install keras tensorflow scikit-learn numpy pillow
```

## How it Works

1. **Image Feature Extraction**: 
   - The script uses the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (without the top fully connected layers) to extract deep features from each image in the input directory. 
   - Each image is resized to 224x224 pixels to match VGG16 input requirements.
   
2. **Clustering**: 
   - The extracted features are fed into a KMeans algorithm to cluster the images into a specified number of clusters (`number_clusters`).
   
3. **Copying and Renaming Images**: 
   - The clustered images are copied to an output directory and renamed with the format `cluster_label_imageindex.jpg`.

## Usage

1. **Define Directories**:
   - Update the `imdir` variable with the path to the directory containing the input images.
   - Set the `targetdir` variable to the directory where you want to save the clustered images.

2. **Set Number of Clusters**:
   - Set the `number_clusters` variable to define how many clusters you want.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Run the script to perform clustering and copy the images.

## Variables

- `imdir`: Path to the directory containing images to be clustered.
- `targetdir`: Path to the output directory where clustered images will be saved.
- `number_clusters`: Number of clusters to group the images into.
  
## Example

If you want to cluster 100 images from `C:/indir/IMG_PERO` into 10 clusters and save the results in `C:/outdir/IMG_PERO_OUTPUT`, adjust the variables as follows:

```python
imdir = 'C:/indir/IMG_PERO'
targetdir = 'C:/outdir/IMG_PERO_OUTPUT'
number_clusters = 10
```

## Notes

- The images are expected to be in `.jpg` format.
- If an image is not successfully processed, it is skipped without halting the script.
- Make sure the output directory exists or the script will attempt to create it.
- The KMeans algorithm might take some time to run depending on the number of images and clusters.

## Error Handling

The script includes basic error handling to skip any failed image processing operations and continues with the next image.
